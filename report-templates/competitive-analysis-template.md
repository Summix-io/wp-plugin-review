## Pattern Recognition Focus

After loading the review data, analyze to identify:

1. **Common Praise**: What features/aspects are consistently mentioned positively?
2. **Recurring Complaints**: What issues appear across multiple reviews?
3. **Rating Patterns**: What separates 5-star from 1-star reviews?
4. **Feature Gap Analysis**: What do users wish existed?
5. **Use Case Insights**: How are different users using the plugin?
6. **Competitive Mentions**: Are users comparing to other plugins?
7. **Version-Specific Issues**: Do certain versions have more complaints?
8. **User Profile Patterns**: Beginners vs. advanced users - different needs?

**Important:** Use your reasoning capabilities to understand nuances, context, and sentiment that automated analysis might miss. Pay attention to:
- Tone and enthusiasm in positive reviews
- Specific pain points in negative reviews
- Constructive feedback vs. venting
- Context around feature requests
- Business impact statements from users

## Report Writing Guidelines

### IMPORTANT - Keep It Concise:
1. **Use tables** instead of paragraphs wherever possible
2. **Limit examples** to one quote per point (not 3-4)
3. **Cut redundancy** - don't repeat the same information in multiple sections
4. **Be selective** - top 5-7 items per category, not exhaustive lists
5. **One-line summaries** instead of multi-paragraph explanations
6. **Skip obvious details** - readers understand what "5-star review" means
7. **Focus on actionable insights** over descriptive analysis
8. **Target length**: 15-25 pages (not 50+ pages)

### Essential vs. Optional:
- ✓ **Essential**: Executive summary, rating distribution, top issues, feature requests, market opportunity
- ✓ **Essential**: Clear evidence and data to back up claims
- ⚠️ **Conditional**: Temporal patterns (only if significant version issues)
- ⚠️ **Conditional**: Detailed technical errors (only if critical/common)
- ✗ **Skip**: Lengthy use case analysis per user type unless dramatically different
- ✗ **Skip**: Exhaustive keyword lists - keep top 10-15 only
- ✗ **Skip**: Review-by-review walkthroughs
- ✗ **Skip**: Repetitive sentiment descriptions across sections

### Tone:
- Direct and actionable
- Data-driven but concise
- Business-focused (this is competitive intelligence, not academic research)
- Use strong statements backed by numbers

## Output Format

Generate the report as a well-structured, **scannable** Markdown document:
- Clear hierarchical headings (##, ###)
- Emoji indicators for major sections (❤️ 👎 🎯 💡)
- **Heavy use of tables** for data presentation
- **Bullet points** (not paragraphs) for lists
- **One quote per point maximum** using > blockquote format
- **Bold** for emphasis on key insights and numbers
- Star ratings: Use simple format (5★, 1★)

### Formatting Examples:

✓ Good (concise):
> "Site crashed after update, lost business hours during peak season" - June 2025 reviewer

✗ Bad (verbose):
> One user stated in their review that they experienced significant technical difficulties when they updated the plugin, which resulted in their website becoming completely inaccessible. This occurred during what they described as a particularly important time for their business operations...

### Table Format Example:
| Issue | Freq | Severity | Impact |
|-------|------|----------|--------|
| Site crashes | 58% | Critical | Revenue loss |

## Special Cases & Edge Cases

### Misclassified Reviews
**Watch for:** 5-star reviews that contain negative content
- Some users accidentally select wrong star rating
- Some users give 5 stars sarcastically with negative title
- **Action:** Manually verify 5-star reviews; note discrepancies in report
- Example: "They don't care or maintain this plugin" with 5 stars

### Empty Review Content
**Watch for:** Reviews with titles but no content text
- Older reviews may have minimal content
- Some users leave only star rating + title
- **Action:** Still valuable for sentiment analysis from title and rating

### Non-English Reviews
**Watch for:** Reviews in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, German, etc.
- WordPress.org is global; plugins get international reviews
- **Action:** Include in analysis; sentiment often clear from context
- Note language distribution in report appendix

### Version-Specific Crises
**Watch for:** Clusters of 1-star reviews on same dates mentioning specific versions
- Indicates catastrophic update failure
- **Action:** Highlight as critical issue in report with timeline
- Example: "Version 3.5.0 - site crash" pattern in June 2025

### Spam/Invalid Reviews
**Watch for:** Generic single-word reviews, repetitive patterns
- Usually minimal on WordPress.org due to moderation
- **Action:** Filter out obvious spam; note in data quality section
